"""data_cache.py — Garmin health data persistence and incremental fetch planning.

Caches the processed health_data dict to data/garmin_data.json so each startup
only fetches what has actually changed:

  Per-day data (daily_stats, sleep, hrv, training_readiness):
    - Today      — always re-fetched (steps/battery/stress change through the day)
    - Yesterday  — re-fetched once per calendar day (sleep score syncs overnight)
    - Older days — served from cache (data is final, never changes)

  Shared data (activities, training_status, body_composition):
    - Re-fetched whenever at least one per-day date is being updated.
    - On a day where everything is already cached (rare edge case), skipped.

Digest and CLI bypass this module entirely — they always do a full fresh fetch.
